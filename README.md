# Get Century From Year 

In this task, implement a `getCentury()` function that:

- accepts the `year` variable;
- returns a century this `year` is in.

Note that the first century begins from the year `1` and continues up to and including the year `100`, the second from the year `101` to the year `200`, and so on.

For example:

```kotlin
getCentury(1705) // 18
getCentury(1900) // 19
getCentury(1601) // 17
getCentury(2000) // 20
```
